In simpler Words , is is an optimization over plain recursion

The idea is to reuse the solutions of subproblems when there are overlapping
subproblems: 1. Memoization (Top Down) 2. Tabulation (Bottom Up)

    Applications:
    1. Bellman Ford Algorithm
    2. Floyd warshall algorithm
    3. Diff Utility(LCS)
    4. Search Closed words(Edit Distance)
    5. Resource Allocation(0-1 Knapsnack)
